# ✅ Version Bumped to 0.2.0 - Ready to Reload!

## What I Did

1. ✅ Bumped version from `0.1.0` → `0.2.0` in `public/manifest.json`
2. ✅ Rebuilt the extension successfully

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Completely Quit Chrome
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Q` (don't just close the window!)
- **Windows:** Right-click Chrome in taskbar → Close all windows

### Step 2: Reopen Chrome and Reload Extension

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Find "GhostWriter" (the old v0.1.0)**
4. Click **"Remove"** button
5. Click **"Load unpacked"** button
6. Select your extension folder: `/Users/nathhui/Documents/Autoflow chrome extension`
7. **Verify version shows `0.2.0`** ← This confirms new code!

### Step 3: Verify the Fix is Active

**BEFORE recording**, open the browser console:

1. Press `F12` → Go to **Console** tab
2. Start recording
3. Click the dropdown **once**
4. **Look for this message:**
   ```
   GhostWriter: ⚠️ BLOCKING duplicate click (timestamp + coordinates match)
   Time diff: 0ms, Coords: (910, 501)
   ```

If you see `BLOCKING duplicate click`, the fix is working! ✅

If you DON'T see it, Chrome is still using cached code ❌

### Step 4: Record a Fresh Workflow

- Click dropdown → Click BOGO
- Stop recording
- Check the JSON

**Expected:** Only **2 clicks** (dropdown → BOGO)

## If It STILL Doesn't Work

Try the "Nuclear Option":

1. Rename extension folder to: `Autoflow chrome extension FIX`
2. Load the RENAMED folder as a new extension
3. Chrome will treat it as completely separate (new ID)

---

## Current Fix Details

The duplicate detection now uses:
- ✅ 50ms time window (handles Date.now() ticking)
- ✅ Same coordinates check
- ✅ Clears marker after async processing completes

This catches event bubbling duplicates while being tolerant of millisecond timing variations.
