# Text Wait Condition Fix - v0.4.5

## Problem

Workflow execution was failing with the error:
```
⏳ GhostWriter: Waiting for text condition (timing: before)
GhostWriter: Error executing step 1: GhostWriter: Timeout waiting for text: Eats Promotion Creation Tool Ver 2.8 Select...
```

The system was trying to wait for text that didn't exist on the page (concatenated/malformed text).

## Root Cause

**File:** `src/content/wait-conditions.ts` (Lines 83-90)

The wait condition determiner was adding a TEXT wait condition based on `elementText`:

```typescript
// If element has text, we can also wait for that text to appear
if (isWorkflowStepPayload(step.payload) && step.payload.elementText) {
  conditions.push({
    type: 'text',
    timing: 'before', // PRE-ACTION: Ensure text is visible
    text: step.payload.elementText,
    timeout: this.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,
  });
}
```

### Why This Failed

`elementText` is often:
1. **Concatenated** from multiple DOM elements (e.g., "Eats Promotion Creation Tool Ver 2.8 Select..." combines page title + dropdown trigger)
2. **Very long** (can include entire page text)
3. **Not an exact match** due to whitespace/formatting differences
4. **Dynamic** (changes between recording and playback)

When the execution engine tried to find this exact text on the page using `document.body.innerText.includes(text)`, it failed because the concatenated text didn't exist as a single string on the page.

## Solution

**Removed** the text-based wait condition entirely (Lines 83-90):

```typescript
// For the first step, DON'T add a wait condition - let findTargetElement handle it
// The element finder has retry logic, XPath support, and multiple fallback strategies
// Adding a wait condition here is redundant and can cause selector compatibility issues
// (e.g., XPath selectors don't work with querySelector)

// REMOVED: Text-based wait conditions are too fragile
// elementText can be:
// - Concatenated from multiple elements
// - Very long (entire page text)
// - Not an exact match due to whitespace/formatting
// The element finder with retry logic is sufficient
```

### Why This Fix Works

The element finder (`findTargetElement()`) already has:
- **Retry logic** (3 attempts with delays)
- **Multiple strategies** (CSS, XPath, semantic)
- **Visibility checks**
- **Timeout handling**

Adding a text wait condition before element finding is:
1. **Redundant** - the element finder already waits for elements
2. **Fragile** - text matching is less reliable than selector matching
3. **Problematic** - can cause false negatives due to text formatting

## Impact

### Before Fix:
```
Step 1: waitForConditions('before')
  ↓
  Wait for text: "Eats Promotion Creation Tool Ver 2.8 Select..."
  ↓
  Text not found (it's concatenated!)
  ↓
  Timeout after 5 seconds ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Step 1: waitForConditions('before')
  ↓
  (no conditions - skipped)
  ↓
  findTargetElement() with retry logic
  ↓
  Element found ✓
  ↓
  Click executed ✓
```

## Testing

### Test Steps:

1. **Reload extension** (v0.4.5)
2. **Navigate to Uber Promotion Tool**
3. **Execute existing workflow** that was failing:
   - Should no longer timeout on "Waiting for text condition"
   - Should proceed directly to element finding
   - Should successfully click dropdown trigger

### Expected Behavior:

Console logs should show:
```
🔄 GhostWriter: Executing pre-action wait conditions...
(no "⏳ Waiting for text condition" message)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
🎯 GhostWriter: Searching for element...
(element finding proceeds immediately)
```

## Files Changed

- `src/content/wait-conditions.ts` (Lines 83-90) - Removed text wait condition
- `public/manifest.json` (version bump to 0.4.5)

## Related Issues

This is part of a series of wait condition fixes:
- v0.4.0: Fixed wait conditions executing before actions
- v0.4.1: Removed element wait conditions (let finder handle it)
- v0.4.2: Improved dropdown menu detection
- v0.4.3: Runtime wait condition regeneration
- v0.4.4: Fixed dropdown variable detection
- **v0.4.5: Removed text wait conditions** ← Current fix

## Design Decision

**Why not improve text matching instead of removing it?**

Text-based wait conditions are fundamentally unreliable because:
1. Text changes frequently (typos, translations, dynamic content)
2. `innerText` concatenates all visible text unpredictably
3. Whitespace normalization is inconsistent across browsers
4. The element finder is already robust enough

**The right approach:** Use selector-based element finding with semantic fallbacks, not text matching.
