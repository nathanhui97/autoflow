# Test Variable Detection After API Key Update

## ✅ Verification Complete

1. **API Key Status**: ✅ Set in Supabase secrets
2. **Function Status**: ✅ Deployed and ACTIVE (version 8)
3. **Fallback Heuristic**: ✅ Implemented (will catch variables even if AI fails)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Record a Test Workflow

1. Open your Chrome extension sidepanel
2. Navigate to a form page (e.g., your promotion tool)
3. Click "Start Recording"
4. Perform these actions:
   - Type **"1000"** in a field labeled "Budget Amount" (or similar)
   - Type **"100"** in a field labeled "Restaurant Funding Percentage" (or similar)
   - Click a dropdown and select an option
5. Click "Stop Recording"

### 2. Check Variable Detection

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Variables section should appear
- ✅ Should detect at least 2 variables:
  - "Budget Amount" with value "1000"
  - "Restaurant Funding Percentage" with value "100"
- ✅ Each variable should show:
  - Field name
  - Variable name (camelCase)
  - Default value
  - Confidence score (should be 0.8+)

### 3. Check Logs

**Sidepanel Console (F12 → Console in sidepanel):**
Look for:
- `[VariableDetector] Edge Function response received:`
- `variablesCount: 2` (or more)
- `confirmedVariables: 2` (or more)

**Supabase Function Logs:**
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jfboagngbpzollcipewh/functions/detect_variables/logs

Look for:
- `[detect_variables] GEMINI_API_KEY is set: AIza...` (should show first 10 chars)
- `[detect_variables] Step X AI response:` (should show successful API calls, not 403 errors)
- `[detect_variables] ✅ Adding variable for step X`

### 4. Success Indicators

✅ **API Working:**
- No 403 errors in Supabase logs
- AI responses show `isVariable: true` for numbers/amounts
- Confidence scores are 0.8+

✅ **Fallback Working (if API fails):**
- Logs show `[detect_variables] ✅ FALLBACK OVERRIDE`
- Variables still detected even if API returns errors

✅ **Variables Detected:**
- Variables appear in UI
- Each variable has proper field name and variable name
- Confidence scores visible

## Troubleshooting

### If API Still Returns 403:
1. Verify the API key is correct: `npx supabase secrets list`
2. Check the key starts with `AIza`
3. Make sure Generative Language API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
4. Wait 2-3 minutes after setting the secret (propagation delay)

### If No Variables Detected:
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify steps have values: `[VariableDetector] Including INPUT step X: value="..."`
3. Check if fallback is triggering: Look for `[detect_variables] Fallback check`
4. Verify the label contains variable keywords (amount, budget, percentage, etc.)

### If Variables Detected But Not Showing:
1. Check sidepanel console for filtering: `confirmedVariables: X`
2. Verify confidence >= 0.5 (should be 0.8+ for numbers)
3. Check if `isVariable: true` in the response

## Next Steps

Once testing confirms everything works:
1. ✅ Variable detection is working
2. ✅ Users can see detected variables in UI
3. ✅ Variables can be customized during workflow execution
4. ✅ Fallback ensures reliability even if AI fails
