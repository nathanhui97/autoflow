# GitHub Repository Setup

Your local git repository is ready! Follow these steps to create and push to GitHub:

## Option 1: Create Repo via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `autoflow-chrome-extension` (or your preferred name)
3. Choose Public or Private
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

6. After creating, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/nathhui/Documents/Autoflow chrome extension"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/autoflow-chrome-extension.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you install it)

If you install GitHub CLI (`brew install gh`), you can run:

```bash
gh auth login
gh repo create autoflow-chrome-extension --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Current Status

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed (41 files, 9954 insertions)
✅ Branch set to `main`

Your commit is ready to push once you create the GitHub repository!
